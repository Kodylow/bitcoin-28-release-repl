# Pay to Anchor (P2A)

## Checklist
1. Understand the concept of Pay to Anchor (P2A)
2. Set up a regtest environment
3. Create a P2A address
4. Create a transaction with a P2A output
5. Sign and send the transaction
6. Create a child transaction spending the P2A output

## Understanding Pay to Anchor (P2A)

Anchors are defined as an output that is added solely to allow a child transaction to CPFP that transaction. Ideally these outputs are just at “dust” satoshi values, and are immediately spent.

A new output script type has been added which allows for an optimized “keyless” version of anchors. The output script is “OP_1 <4e73>” which requires no witness data to spend, meaning a fee reduction compared to existing anchor outputs and allows anyone to spend it.

This new output type has a dust limit of 240 satoshis. 

## Testing Pay to Anchor (P2A)

Follow these steps to test P2A in a regtest environment:

1. Regtest address for P2A is “bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx” in regtest, “bc1pfeessrawgf” in mainnet

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest getaddressinfo bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx
# {
#   "address": "bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx",
#   "scriptPubKey": "51024e73",
#   "ismine": false,
#   "solvable": false,
#   "iswatchonly": false,
#   "isscript": true,
#   "iswitness": true,
#   "ischange": false,
#   "labels": [
#   ]
# }
```

2. Decode the P2A script:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest decodescript 51024e73
# {
#   "asm": "1 29518",
#   "desc": "addr(bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx)#swxgse0y",
#   "address": "bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx",
#   "type": "anchor"
# }
```

### Create a transaction with both a P2WPKH output and a P2A output

3. First, mine some blocks to make sure the package txs you sent are confirmed and make sure you have some regtest coins to work with.

```bash
# Mine some more blocks to get some regtest coins
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test generate 10
# and confirm you have some spendable coins
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test listunspent
```

Select a coin to use for the transaction, just use the first one in the list for now. For the amount, use the complete amount of the coin minus 240 satoshis, which will be on the P2A output.

4. Create a new P2WPKH address to send the P2A output to:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test getnewaddress
```

5. Create the transaction with a P2WPKH output and a P2A output, then convert to v3 to allow the parent tx to have 0 fee

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest createrawtransaction '[{"txid": "YOUR_TXID_FOR_INPUT", "vout": 0}]' '[{"YOUR_ADDRESS_FOR_P2WPKH": "49.99999760"}, {"bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx": "0.00000240"}]'
# 0200000001895105e396e9b15401eec931e25b5b7caab3146f8044f8f0838a846bea9f9f980000000000fdffffff0210f1052a01000000160014be0c5b9422839ee959d683f7d3e61184fab9a518f0000000000000000451024e7300000000
# Change the output to a v3 transaction (first 2 characters to 03) so we can have this parent be no fee
# 0300000001895105e396e9b15401eec931e25b5b7caab3146f8044f8f0838a846bea9f9f980000000000fdffffff0210f1052a01000000160014be0c5b9422839ee959d683f7d3e61184fab9a518f0000000000000000451024e7300000000
```

4. Sign the v3 transaction

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet YOUR_V3_PARENT_RAW_TX_HEX
```

5. Send the v3 transaction

```bash
# Add the 0 at the end to turn off the sanity fee check
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test sendrawtransaction YOUR_SIGNED_V3_PARENT_RAW_TX_HEX "0"
```

We see that the transaction on its own is rejected because there's no fee. So we'll add a child transaction using a different utxo as one input, and the P2A output as the other input, and we'll see that the package is accepted.

### Create a child transaction spending the P2A output:

First, let's get the txid of the parent transaction and confirm the P2A is the 2nd output.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest decoderawtransaction YOUR_SIGNED_V3_PARENT_RAW_TX_HEX
# {
#   "txid": "YOUR_PARENT_TXID",
#   ...
#   "vin": [
#      ...
#   ],
#   "vout": [
#      { # P2WPKH output
#        "value": 49.99999760,
#        "n": 0,
#        "scriptPubKey": {
#          ...
#        }
#      },
#      { # P2A output, make sure this is the second output
#        "value": 0.00000240,
#        "n": 1,
#        "scriptPubKey": {
#          "asm": "1 29518",
#          "desc": "addr(bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx)#swxgse0y",
#          "hex": "51024e73",
#          "address": "bcrt1pfeesnyr2tx",
#          "type": "anchor"
#        }
#      }
#   ],
# }
```

Next, make sure you have some other utxo to use as an input for the child transaction.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test listunspent
```

Select a new coin to use for the child transaction, don't use the same one you used for the parent transaction.

Now, create the child transaction with the P2A output as one of the inputs and the other coin as another input to bring fees. We'll just pay it back to ourselves, so do the full amount minus a couple thousand satoshis for fees.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest createrawtransaction '[{"txid": "YOUR_PARENT_TXID", "vout": 1}, {"txid": "YOUR_OTHER_UTXO_TXID", "vout": 0}]' '[{"ANOTHER_BITCOIN_ADDRESS_RECEIVE_TO": "YOUR_AMOUNT_MINUS_FEES"}]'
# Replace the 02 with 03 to make it a v3 transaction
```

7. Sign the child transaction, providing the additional info about the parent tx's P2A output you're using as one of the inputs.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet YOUR_CHILD_TX_HEX '[{"txid": "YOUR_PARENT_TXID", "vout": 1, "scriptPubKey": "51024e73", "amount": 0.00000240}]'
```

Now we're ready to send both transactions as a package, where the 240 sat anchor output is spent and the parent transaction is CPFPed.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test submitpackage "["YOUR_SIGNED_V3_PARENT_RAW_TX_HEX_WITH_ANCHOR", "YOUR_SIGNED_CHILD_TX_HEX_SPENDING_ANCHOR"]"
```

And you'll see the package is accepted.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest getrawmempool
# ["PACKAGE_HASH"]
```

## P2A Use Cases

P2A outputs are particularly useful in scenarios like:

1. Lightning Network:
   - Reduce blockspace usage from two anchors to a single keyless anchor
   - Outsource fee bumping to agents without privileged key material
   - Simplify commitment transactions and reduce their size

2. Coinjoins:
   - Add P2A output to allow segregated wallets or watchtowers to pay for transaction fees

3. General transactions:
   - Efficient fee bumping for any transaction without requiring additional signatures
