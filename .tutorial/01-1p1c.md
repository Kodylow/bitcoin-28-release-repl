## Understanding 1P1C Relay

Prior to Bitcoin Core 28.0, each transaction must meet or exceed the local nodeâ€™s dynamic mempool minimum feerate in order to even enter its mempool. This value rises and falls roughly along the line of transaction congestion, creating a floor for propagating a payment. This creates a huge headache for wallets dealing with presigned transactions that cannot sign replacements and have to predict what the future floor value will be when it comes time, at an unknown date, to settle the transaction. This is hard enough in the minutes time frame, but clearly impossible over months.

When submitting a transaction below the mempoolminfee or minrelaytxfee, the transaction is rejected outright:
```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest sendrawtransaction YOUR_TX_HEX
# error code: -26
# error message:
# min relay fee not met, 0 < 110
```

Package relay has been a long sought after feature for the network to mitigate this. Once properly developed and deployed widely on the network, this would allow wallet developers to bring fees to a transaction via related transactions, allowing low-fee ancestors to be included in the mempool..

For this release of Bitcoin Core a limited variant of package relay has been implemented which allows a single parent into the mempool, regardless of the dynamic mempool minimum feereate using a single child, a simple Child Pays For Parent(CPFP). If the child transaction has additional unconfirmed parents, these transactions will not successfully propagate. This simplified the implementation greatly and allowed other mempool work such as Cluster Mempool to continue unabated while still targeting a large number of use-cases.

Unless a transaction is a TRUC transaction(see [10-truc.md](10-truc.md) for more details), every transaction must still meet a *static* 1 satoshi per virtual byte minimum. (For the example below, we'll be using a 0 feerate parent Transaction using TRUC)

One final caveat to the feature is the propagation guarantees for this release are also limited. If the Bitcoin Core node is connected to a sufficiently determined adversary, it is likely to disrupt propagation of the parent and child transaction pair. Additional hardening of package relay continues as an ongoing project: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27463 

General package relay remains a future work, to be informed by data from limited package relay and its rollout on the network.

## Testing 1P1C Relay

Follow these steps to test 1P1C relay in a regtest environment:

1. Set up the regtest environment and create a wallet: (hit the "Run" button to start bitcoind on regtest in the background then run the following commands in a shell. When you first enter a shell, run `nix develop` to configure the dev shell with the correct environment variables for the bitcoin binaries.)

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest createwallet test
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test getnewaddress
# This will return an address starting with "bcrt1", you'll need to use this address for the next step.
```

2. Generate some coins and check your unspent outputs (you'll need to use the txid and vout for the next step, make sure this returns some coins before proceeding)

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test -generate 101
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test listunspent
# This will return something like this, you'll need to use the txid and vout for the next step
[
  {
    "txid": "d1762b3a9c2f617ccef2d7e5d4f98416a81a85ae4cce4cc529b4836b50b3af55",
    "vout": 0,
    ...
    "amount": 50.00000000
  }
]
```

Now let's check the mempool minfeerate:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest getmempoolinfo
# This will return something like this:
# {
#   "loaded": true,
#   "size": 0,
#   "bytes": 0,
#   "usage": 0,
#   "total_fee": 0.00000000,
#   "maxmempool": 300000000,
#   "mempoolminfee": 0.00001000,
#   "minrelaytxfee": 0.00001000,
#   "incrementalrelayfee": 0.00001000,
#   "unbroadcastcount": 0,
#   "fullrbf": true
# }
```

We can see that the mempoolminfee and minrelaytxfee are both 0.00001000, this is the minimum feerate that a transaction must have to be accepted into the mempool. We'll now create a parent transaction with 0 feerate and confirm that it can't enter the mempool.

> [!TIP] 0 Fee Parent Transactions: 
> Normally Bitcion transactions require at least 1 sat/vbyte to be included at all, however, with Version 3 transactions, we can submit 0 fee transactions that have children with a >1sat/vbyte feerate.
> For more information about Topology Restricted Until Confirmed (TRUC) Transactions, see [10-truc.md](10-truc.md)

### Creating the Parent Transaction

3. Create a low-fee parent transaction (using 0 fee v3 transaction for this example):

```bash
# I'm using the txid from the unspent output we checked earlier and the address we generated in the first step.
bitcoin-cli -regtest createrawtransaction '[{"txid": "YOUR_TXID", "vout": 0}]' '[{"YOUR_ADDRESS": "FULL_AMOUNT"}]'
# e.g. bitcoin-cli -regtest createrawtransaction '[{"txid": "d1762b3a9c2f617ccef2d7e5d4f98416a81a85ae4cce4cc529b4836b50b3af55", "vout": 0}]' '[{"bcrt1q7z2p6gg8qp4kac9t9rz5q0k8qqnyd8chhvya94": 50}]'
# This will return a raw transaction hex like this:
# 020000000155afb3506b83b429c54cce4cae851aa81684f9d4e5d7f2ce7c612f9c3a2b76d10000000000fdffffff0100f2052a01000000160014f0941d2107006b6ee0ab28c5403ec70026469f1700000000
# Replace "02" with "03" at the start of the hex to make it a TRUC transaction
# 030000000155afb3506b83b429c54cce4cae851aa81684f9d4e5d7f2ce7c612f9c3a2b76d10000000000fdffffff0100f2052a01000000160014f0941d2107006b6ee0ab28c5403ec70026469f1700000000
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet YOUR_RAW_TX_HEX_STARTING_WITH_03_INSTEAD_OF_02
```

4. Attempt to send the parent transaction (this will fail due to low fees):

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest sendrawtransaction YOUR_SIGNED_PARENT_TX_HEX
# This will return an error like this:
# error code: -26
# error message:
# min relay fee not met, 0 < 110
```

Now, we'll use package relay and Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) to increase the feerate of the parent transaction so they can both enter the mempool. This is done by creating a child transaction that pays to the same address as the parent, but with a higher feerate. This child transaction is then added to the parent transaction and sent to the network as a single package.

### Creating the Child Transaction

We decode the transaction to get the parent's output and scriptpubkey to use as the input for the child transaction.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest decoderawtransaction YOUR_SIGNED_PARENT_TX_HEX
# This will return something like this:
# [
#   {
#     "txid": "dcdf8b56c476774c2dca90d2bce42d5b88222386922bb4bfd398693329bb1686", # The txid of the parent transaction
#     ...
#     "vout": { # The output of the parent transaction that we'll spend as the input for the child transaction
#       "value": 50.00000000,
#       "scriptPubKey": { # The scriptpubkey of the parent transaction that we'll spend as the input for the child transaction
#          ...
#          "hex": "0014f0941d2107006b6ee0ab28c5403ec70026469f17", # We'll use this to tell the wallet that the parent transaction's output is spendable
#          "address": "bcrt1q7z2p6gg8qp4kac9t9rz5q0k8qqnyd8chhvya94",
#       }
#     }
#   }
# ]
```

5. We create a child transaction spending the parent transaction's output to the same address, but with a higher feerate. For this example we'll just make the fees a round 10000 satoshis.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest createrawtransaction '[{"txid": "PARENT_TXID", "vout": 0}]' '[{"YOUR_ADDRESS": "49.9999"}]'
# This will return a raw transaction hex like this:
# 02000000018616bb29336998d3bfb42b92862322885b2de4bcd290ca2d4c7776c4568bdfdc0000000000fdffffff01f0ca052a01000000160014f0941d2107006b6ee0ab28c5403ec70026469f1700000000
# Replace 02 with 03 to make it a TRUC transaction like
# 03000000018616bb29336998d3bfb42b92862322885b2de4bcd290ca2d4c7776c4568bdfdc0000000000fdffffff01f0ca052a01000000160014f0941d2107006b6ee0ab28c5403ec70026469f1700000000
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet YOUR_CHILD_TX_HEX_WITH_03_INSTEAD_OF_02
```

This will initally fail because the child is spending parent's output that doesn't exist yet (couldn't be submitted to mempool remember?). When we sign the child transaction, we'll also have to provide the info about the parent transaction's output we're spending:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet YOUR_CHILD_TX_HEX_WITH_03_INSTEAD_OF_02 '[{"txid": "PARENT_TXID", "vout": 0, "scriptPubKey": "PARENT_OUTPUT_SCRIPTPUBKEY", "amount": "PARENT_OUTPUT_FULL_AMOUNT"}]'
#
# The complete command using the example values from the previous steps (your values will be different):
# bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test signrawtransactionwithwallet 0300000001b312cf70777f6963471ea759c8e948095e0a6eda63c18ef2519cb3d6e798d0f50000000000fdffffff01606b042a0100000016001445a26beeb437bd1f73bd5c810778eaf7582e79e300000000 '[{"txid": "f5d098e7d6b39c51f28ec163da6e0a5e0948e9c859a71e4763697f7770cf12b3", "vout": 0, "scriptPubKey": "001445a26beeb437bd1f73bd5c810778eaf7582e79e3", "amount": "50"}]'
```

And now you have the signed child transaction. This child transaction is spending a parent transaction's output that doesn't exist yet, but the parent transaction's fee is too low to be included in the mempool, so we have to submit both transactions as a package to get the parent into the mempool by incentivizing the miner to include it to get the fees from the child.

### Submitting the 1P1C Package

6. The new bitcoin-cli command to submit the 1P1C package is `submitpackage`, and it takes a JSON array of the parent and child transaction hex strings.

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcwallet=test submitpackage '["PARENT_TX_HEX", "CHILD_TX_HEX"]'
```

If successful, you should see a response indicating that the package was accepted into the mempool, with details about the transactions and their effective feerates. 

```bash
# Example response:
# {
#   "package_msg": "success",
#   "tx-results": {
#     "PARENT_TX_ID": {
#       "txid": "PARENT_TX_ID",
#       "vsize": PARENT_TX_VSIZE,
#       "fees": {
#         "base": PARENT_TX_BASE_FEE,
#         "effective-feerate": PARENT_TX_EFFECTIVE_FEERATE,
#         "effective-includes": [
#           "PARENT_TX_ID",
#           "CHILD_TX_ID"
#         ]
#       }
#     },
#     "CHILD_TX_ID": {
#       "txid": "CHILD_TX_ID",
#       "vsize": CHILD_TX_VSIZE,
#       "fees": {
#         "base": CHILD_TX_BASE_FEE,
#         "effective-feerate": CHILD_TX_EFFECTIVE_FEERATE,
#         "effective-includes": [
#           "PARENT_TX_ID",
#           "CHILD_TX_ID"
#         ]
#       }
#     }
#   },
#   "replaced-transactions": [
#   ]
# }
```



You'll be able to see that both TXs are in the mempool:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -regtest getmempoolinfo
{
  "loaded": true,
  "size": 2, # 2 transactions in the mempool
  "bytes": 220,
  "usage": 2352,
  "total_fee": 0.00100000,
  "maxmempool": 300000000,
  "mempoolminfee": 0.00001000,
  "minrelaytxfee": 0.00001000,
  "incrementalrelayfee": 0.00001000,
  "unbroadcastcount": 0,
  "fullrbf": true
}
```

Now we'll try to bump the parent alone by attaching a fee, see that it fails because the package's feerate is higher, then increase the fee of the child to make the new package's feerate higher still, and replace the package of transactions successfully.
